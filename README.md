<h2>Short Description</h2>
  <h3>What is the problem?</h3>
  <p> The world generates 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste annually, with at least 33 percent of that—extremely conservatively—not managed in an environmentally safe manner. <br> And in the future, by 2050, global waste is expected to grow to 3.40 billion tonnes, which is more than double population growth over the same period. </p>
